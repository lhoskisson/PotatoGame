Changes to potatoProjectiles:
	10/28: put capsule colliders on projectiles.
	
	10/28: created tag "Projectile" so enemies could register hits based on the tag.

	IDEA FOR CHANGE(10/28):
	In the future we could make an armor piercing upgrade that allows the potatos to collide with multiple enemies, upgrades could just increase the counter.


Changes to carrots:
	10/28: created tag "Enemy" to work with ProjectileScript.

	10/28: Removed many now irrelevant comments and a couple lines of irrelevant commented out code in CarrotBehavior.

	10/29: added application of damage to potato crop when carrot collides with potato, damage is applied once per second while a carrot is touching a crop.

	10/29: added fixed update for updating the damage to potatoCrops, should be more stable than update.

	CARROT BUG NOTICED(10/28):
	When all of the carrots stack on top of eachother on a potato, it only takes one projectile to kill all of them since their colliders line up perfectly.
	We could write this off as a design choice and make it easier for players to defend their farm, or we can fix it (i think we should fix it, otherwise the
	standard cannon could be quite strong and there would be less stress to obtain upgrades).

	Worthwhile note(10/29):
	I tried using a polygon collider on the carrot enemies and it seemed to cause a serious performance hit. We may want to avoid them when we can.

Changes to potato crops:

	10/29: added code to search for the potato manager in the start method (also added start method)
